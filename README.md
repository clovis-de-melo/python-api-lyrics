`API` is the acronym for Application Programming Interface, a software intermediary that allows two applications to talk to each other. 

`pip` (also known by Python 3's alias pip3) is a package-management system written in Python and is used to install and manage software packages.[4] The Python Software Foundation recommends using pip for installing Python applications and its dependencies during deployment.[5] Pip connects to an online repository of public packages, called the Python Package Index. Pip can be configured to connect to other package repositories (local or remote), provided that they comply to Python Enhancement Proposal 503.
